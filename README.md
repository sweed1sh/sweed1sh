- 👋 Hi, I’m @sweed1sh
- 👀 I’m interested in all types of design that help to improve a persons experience in life, whether it be physical, visual or conceptual.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python with a view to create some projects. I am also learning JavaScript, html and css with a view to make a website/place to show my projects that is not built in Wordpress (like my current website is).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and anything that people will have me on. I am very early in my 'learning to code' journey, but I hear the best way to learn is to build projects and find and interact with other likeminded people.
- 📫 How to reach me - I am contactable through my website at cjhmason.com and at cjhmason@gmail.com
- I look forward to continuing on this journey to improve my skills and learn for awesome people, and at some point (when I have the skills) to contribute to projects where I can!
